Artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, predictive analytics, and personalized treatment strategies. Machine learning systems support clinicians by analyzing imaging data, identifying risk factors, and assisting with clinical decision making. However, AI adoption is constrained by issues such as data privacy, model transparency, bias, and integration into clinical workflows. Ongoing research aims to improve model reliability and ensure safe deployment in real medical environments.
