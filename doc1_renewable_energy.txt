Renewable energy technologies have expanded rapidly as nations work toward cleaner and more resilient energy systems. Solar and wind power continue to dominate global installations due to falling costs and widespread governmental support. Despite this progress, large-scale integration still faces challenges related to grid stability, storage capacity, and regulatory coordination. Future development of renewables depends on improving technology efficiency, expanding smart grids, and addressing policy barriers.
