Information retrieval focuses on identifying relevant documents from large datasets using structured algorithms and ranking functions. Traditional approaches include Boolean models, vector space models, and probabilistic frameworks. Modern IR systems integrate machine learning, semantic analysis, and user behavior patterns to improve relevance scoring. Evaluating retrieval effectiveness relies on metrics such as precision, recall, and ranking accuracy.
