Tourism in Nepal is shaped by its natural landscapes, cultural heritage, and adventure activities. Sustainable tourism initiatives aim to balance economic growth with environmental conservation and community well-being. Despite increasing visitor interest, Nepal faces obstacles like weak infrastructure, seasonal fluctuations, and limited environmental safeguards. Strengthening local participation, promoting eco-friendly practices, and improving policy frameworks are essential for long-term tourism development.
